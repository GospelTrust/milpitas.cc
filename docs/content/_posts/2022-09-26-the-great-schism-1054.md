The break between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy
<!--more-->
## Previous Schisms & Controversies

- Over centuries the Greek-speaking Eastern **Orthodox** / **Byzantine** Church and the Latin-speaking **Roman Catholic** Church had steadily grown further and further apart, with different liturgies, different organizations, and somewhat different theologies. They would declare themselves the same church spiritually, but in practical matters were different organizations. However, there were several crises over time that split them apart

- [Iconoclasm]

  - The controversy over the use of images of Jesus and saints made the **Roman Catholics** decide that the Eastern **Orthodox** Church was just a puppet church ruled by the emperor, so the **West** lost respect for the **East**

- **Muslim** conquests in the east and barbarian invasions in the north and west

  - Without a strong western empire, all the western European lands were vulnerable to repeated invasions by the likes of Germanic tribes, Magyars, Vikings, etc. The **Roman** pope was often the only figure regarded as a universal leader in the west, and so the popes did whatever they could to protect **western Europe** from invasions.

  - The popes would appeal to the **Byzantines** to defend them, since the **Byzantine** emperor in **Constantinople** claimed jurisdiction over **Rome** and the **Roman** church.

  - But the **Byzantines** were now too busy fighting the **Muslim** invasions in the east, and they simply did next to nothing to defend the **west**

  - So **Rome** stopped counting on **Byzantium** for help, and turned instead to the Christian **Franks** up north for help.

  - This further separated **East** and **West**

- 9th-10th centuries – possibly the lowest point ever for the **Roman papacy**, as the office of pope was traded politically, popes were murdered by their successors, popes had mistresses, and one pope even began his reign by toasting the devil.

  - These popes also continued to argue for their supremacy over the entire **Christian Church worldwide**, but that was always flatly refused by the **East**, who had less and less reason to respect the popes

- However, theologically the **East** continued to be more turbulent and violent than the **West**. The **West** tended to hold steadily to old orthodox theology, and while they didn’t produce many brilliant theologians, they also produced fewer heretics and controversies. Meanwhile, the **East** could barely claim any kind of unity. Their patriarchs weren’t as powerful as popes were in **Rome**, but they were still the victims of ugly politics

- The [Nicene Creed](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1PHsQF7VQ_kDzx-N-DQtPHjYF7qusvy0I9DKNHXLXer0/edit) and the _filioque_ clause

  - The original **Nicene Creed** had stated that the Holy Spirit proceeds “from the Father” only. Subsequent ecumenical councils had declared that the Creed should never be altered

  - But theology continued to develop, and in the **West** it was being taught that the Holy Spirit should proceed from the Son as well as the Father, in order to maintain equality among the Trinity.

    - Somewhere in Spain, the **Nicene Creed** was altered to say that the Holy Spirit proceeded “from the Father _and the Son_” – _filioque_ is Latin for “and the son”

    - Meanwhile the Eastern **Orthodox** Church asserted that the Spirit proceeds “from the Father, _through_ the Son”

  - Slowly this spread throughout **Roman Catholicism**. By Charlemagne’s time the **Creed** recited in his capital already had the _filioque_ clause

  - The **East** was barely aware that this had happened but was furious when they heard

- 867 - Photian Schism

  - Political scheming in Constantinople replaced **Patriarch Ignatius**  with **Patriarch Photius**, who was a lay scholar and brilliant theologian. However, **Pope Nicholas** didn’t understand how important lay theologians were to Eastern theology and was offended that **Photius** had never before been a clergyman. There was a further dispute between **Photius** and **Nicholas** over who had jurisdiction over certain dioceses

  - Both patriarchs appealed to **Pope Nicholas** of  **Rome** for support, and the pope sided with **Ignatius**

  - **Photius** was incensed and convened an **Eastern** council in which he excommunicated **Pope Nicholas** and characterized him as an enemy of the **Byzantine** Church. He also called the **Roman Catholic** Church heretical because it had dared to change the **Nicene Creed**, without even consulting the **East** and calling a council

  - Political changes in Constantinople ended up restoring **Ignatius** as patriarch, and **Pope Nicholas** died and was replaced by Pope Adrian II who wanted to heal the schism. However they were unable to find a compromise.

  - By **878** however **Patriarch Ignatius** had died and **Photius** was appointed to be patriarch again. Yet another pope was now in **Rome**, and this pope needed **Byzantine** naval help against **Muslim** raiders, and so they finally managed to work out a compromise and the schism officially ended.

  - The popes, exasperated and not wanting to alienate **Byzantium** any more nor to offend the **Franks** (who recited the _filioque_ clause), started dropping the **Nicene Creed** altogether in favor of the old **Apostles’ Creed**, which had largely been forgotten until then

  - But the bitterness over the schism remained

## Great Schism of 1054

- Final official schism between **East** and **West**, although there were later events that cemented it even more

- A Bulgarian archbishop accused **Roman Catholicism** of error because they refused to let clergymen marry and because they conducted communion with unleavened bread. He provoked this into a major controversy

- **Pope Leo IX** sent an ambassador to **Constantinople** to resolve the issue, but he chose **Cardinal Humbert**, who was vehemently anti-**Eastern** and didn’t care to learn Greek

  - **Cardinal Humbert**’s personal reform policy included expanding clerical celibacy and keeping the Church away from the influence of secular rulers, so naturally he was disgusted with the Eastern **Orthodox** Church that was under the emperor’s authority and allowed priests and bishops to marry

- **Cardinal Humbert** and **Patriarch Michael Cerularius** argued and insulted each other in **Constantinople**

- June 16, **1054** – as the patriarch was preparing a communion service, **Cardinal Humbert** entered the Hagia Sophia and, in the name of the pope, delivered a letter (written by himself) in which he excommunicated the patriarch and declared the entire Eastern **Orthodox** Church heretical. As he left the building, someone begged him to reconsider, but he just kept walking and left for **Rome**

## Further breaks

- Various attempts were made to heal the **Schism of 1054**, but none were successful until 1965.

- The Crusades did further damage to the relationship. The Crusades were launched almost entirely by medieval **Catholic** Europe and did not much benefit the **East**. In fact, the **Fourth Crusade** sacked **Constantinople** in 1204 and **Westerners** ruled the city and much of **Byzantine** territory until 1261, when the **Byzantine** emperor finally reclaimed the old capitol. But the **Byzantine** empire never recovered from the blow, and this also had a huge negative impact on the Eastern **Orthodox** Church.

-  **1965** - **Pope Paul VI** and **Patriarch Athenagoras I** met in **Jerusalem** and formally restored each other to communion. Many on either side have since hoped for the two organizations to actually unite, but so far the differences that developed over some 1700 years have proven too big to overcome. But official relations have gotten friendlier.
