_Christianity south of Egypt in the kingdom of Aksum_

## The Kingdom of Aksum/Axum

- The Kingdom of Aksum (c. AD 100-1100) became one of the most powerful trading powers in the region, especially in the 3rd-6th centuries

- They remained powerful and influential until the rise of Arab Islamic kingdoms in the 7th and 8th centuries reduced their power

- 12th-13th centuries – Ethiopian power shifted to a new dynasty that was no longer Aksumite, but they remained Christian

## Christianity in Aksum

- There’s a tradition that the apostles Matthew and Bartholomew evangelized Ethiopia, but no evidence of it. Of course Acts 8 records that Philip converted a high-ranking Ethiopian eunuch, but we don’t know if he was able to spread the gospel to his own people

- Christianity spread south from Egypt along the Nile until it reached the kingdom of Aksum, which formed the core of latter-day Ethiopia. The Ethiopian Church was always connected to the Egyptian/Coptic Church

- Founders are considered to be the brothers Saint **Frumentius** (_pictured right_) and **Aedesius**

  - They were Syrian Christians who were captured by the Ethiopians in AD 340

  - Worked as civil servants to the Aksumite king, whom they eventually converted to Christianity

  - When the king died, the queen appointed **Frumentius** as the royal administrator and as the young prince’s tutor

  - **Frumentius** was able to secure greater freedom for Christians and their evangelism

  - C. 347 – **Frumentius** visited [Athanasius] in **Alexandria**, who consecrated him as a bishop and commissioned him to adapt Christian texts and liturgy into language and symbols meaningful to the Aksumites

  - **Frumentius** founded a church in the Aksumite capital, baptized the king (whom he had previously tutored), and the Christianity of **Alexandria** became the official religion of the Kingdom of Aksum

  - **Frumentius** opposed [Arianism] and worked to keep it out of Aksum

  - Aedesiusis the one who related Frumentius’ accomplishments to a Christian historian, Rufinus

  - The Aksumites took to calling **Frumentius** _abuna_ “Our Father,” which is still used for the patriarch of the **Ethiopian Orthodox Church (EOC)**

- C. end of the 5th century – Syrian monks bring monasticism to Ethiopia and begin translating the Bible into Ge’ez, one of the local languages which now exists only as the liturgical language of the **Ethiopian Orthodox Church** (like their version of Latin)

- 451 – the **EOC** follows the lead of the **Coptic Church of Alexandria** in rejecting the [Council of Chalcedon]'s decision on the two equal natures of Jesus Christ. The **EOC** becomes **miaphysite**, asserting that the mystery of the Incarnation enables Jesus to have one nature in which the divine and human are equally present. They get labeled [monophysites] by Chalcedonian churches

  - This is why the **EOC** added the word _tewahedo_ to their name (**Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church**), because it means “unity” and is meant to express their belief in Jesus’ singular nature that unites the divine with the human

- 7th century – Muslim conquests in Arabia and northern Africa cut the Ethiopian Church off from most other Christian churches, although there was an Ethiopian monastery in Jerusalem that was able to maintain some contact with the home country

  - The **EOC** did absorb syncretistic beliefs during this time

- 12th century – long-running conflict developed in the **EOC** when the patriarch of **Alexandria** began appointing only Egyptian **Coptic** monks as the archbishop of **Ethiopia**. The strong Ethiopian **monastic** community, led by a native abbott general, opposed this practice and advocated for **Ethiopian** leadership of the **EOC**

- **Emperor Lalibela** (1162-1221) constructed massive monolithic churches hewn from rock that remain to this day

- The Ethiopian elite have always been nominally Christian up through the 20th century and viewed Islam with suspicion or hostility

- It wasn’t until the 20th century that a compromise between the Ethiopian monastics and **Alexandria** was reached.

  - the Ethiopians regained ultimate control of their church, being recognized as an independent church with their own patriarch, although they agreed to give honorary primacy to the **Coptic** patriarch in **Alexandria**

- In the mid-20th century the **EOC** became a state church of Ethiopia and supported **Emperor Haile Selassie I**

- 1974 – the abolition of the monarchy and the institution of socialism also saw end of the **EOC**’s role as the state church, although it remained the country’s most influential religion

- 1993-4 – Eritrea gained independence from Ethiopia, and Eritrean Christians appealed to **Pope Shenouda III of the Coptic Church** to be recognized as an independent church, which he granted. The **EOC** recognized the **Eritrean Orthodox Church** in 1998

- 20th century saw the **Ethiopian Orthodox Church** enter into fruitful talks with Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic leaders, where they were able to resolve many issues that had previously cut them off from each other

- Until 1900, the **EOC**’s church schools were the only schools in Ethiopia
