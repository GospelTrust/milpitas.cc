## Details
Peripateo means to walk. How do you know you're walking in the right way? Do you struggle to discern what's godly and worldly? Are the things your friends, and even teachers tell you biblical? Are the things you hear on social media the truth?

Peripateo connects you with godly men and women from our friends' churches to help you discern biblical principles from the world's relative truths.
