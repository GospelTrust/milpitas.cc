## A Spiritual Family

- The family of **Macrina**, **Basil**, and **Gregory of Nyssa** had been Christians for many generations and were well-respected in Caesarea, the main city of [Cappadocia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Asia_Minor_in_the_Greco-Roman_period_-_general_map_-_regions_and_main_settlements.jpg/1280px-Asia_Minor_in_the_Greco-Roman_period_-_general_map_-_regions_and_main_settlements.jpg) (map)

- **Macrina** chose a life of celibacy and spiritual contemplation after her fiancée died

- Her brother **Basil** had the best education in the great cities of the East: Caesarea (in Cappadocia), Antioch, Constantinople, and Athens. He studied law and rhetoric

  - In Athens he met and befriended **Gregory of Nazianzus**

- When **Basil** returned home to Caesarea and got a good position teaching rhetoric, he acted pridefully because of his high education and family prestige. His sister **Macrina** rebuked him for his behavior and said that he’d been admiring too many pagan writers and not enough Christian ones. At the time, he brushed her off

- Another brother of theirs, Naucatius, died suddenly; this brother had been living a very humble, spiritual life, and had been very close to **Basil**. This emotional shock caused **Basil** to reevaluate his life. Their father had also died around this time.

  - **Basil** resigned his teaching job and other honors he had accrued, and asked **Macrina** to teach him how to live a spiritual life

- **Macrina** was now the spiritual leader and main provider of the family. She encouraged the whole family to move to a nearby town called Annesi to live in spiritual contemplation and the denial of worldly things.

  - She had been inspired by what she read of the desert [ascetics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uOAYMib56x33cdgsK83x6UwANiCdT3KHCWjr-TkKhHA/edit#heading=h.1ca35kahhb6b) in Egypt

  - The women of the family followed **Macrina** to Annesi, where they founded a monastic community for women

  - They freed their slaves, who were allowed to stay with them as equals

  - They fed the poor and took care of abandoned or starving children

  - **Basil**, on **Macrina’s** advice, went to Egypt to study from the [monks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uOAYMib56x33cdgsK83x6UwANiCdT3KHCWjr-TkKhHA/edit#heading=h.92ywptyiuzoh) there

- **Macrina** became so famed and respected from her life in Annesi that locals called her “the Teacher”

### Basil “the Great” of Caesarea (329-379)

<img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/6i7Qi8U5XxD_5ys3ZvOixrofqrpCmaV4IAP6tqszjdWW9YPrudyS5SXD9SJDwpeS_-aKq1OfDWaQcijpeWjzaYSpjn5Tw7GMXfqmuPmdMPP9bBqWWYP9ca5i1Z6hezkNBOiQQQtI8-0KSWPYxw" width="150" style="float: right" />

- **Basil** returned from his studies with the monks and settled near Annesi

- **Gregory of Nazianzus** finished his studies in Athens and joined **Basil**

- Together **Basil** and **Gregory of Nazianzus** founded a **monastic community** similar to the one **Macrina** had founded for women

- **Basil** emphasized a life of service to the **community**, which he modeled by doing the least desirable tasks himself

- During this time he wrote the rules that became the foundation of all later Greek **monasticism**

- After 6 years **Basil** was made a priest against his will, but he had such strong conflicts with the bishop of Caesarea that he went back to his **monastic community**  in order to promote peace

- When Emperor **Valens** (r. 364-378) began his reign as a militant **Arian**, **Basil** returned to Caesarea to help the bishop resist the **Arian** party which tried to take over the church

- **Basil** saw that the city was suffering because of a bad harvest and the rich people hoarding the little food available all for themselves. **Basil** preached about giving, and he sold all his own possessions to feed the poor

  > If one who takes the clothing off another is called a thief, why give any other name to one who can clothe the naked and refuses to do so? The bread that you withhold belongs to the poor; the cape that you hide in your chest belongs to the naked; the shoes rotting in your house belong to those who must go unshod.

- **Basil** organized a sort of miniature city, called Basiliad, on the outskirts of Caesarea where the poor and sick were cared for and given employment. Basil collected resources from the city’s rich, telling them that to give to the poor willingly was to build up treasures in heaven

- Soon **Basil** was elected bishop of Caesarea

- Emperor **Valens**, an **Arian**, tried to bully **Basil** out of the church.

  - But when the captain sent to bully him threatened to confiscate all of **Basil’s** belongings and see him exiled, tortured, and executed, **Basil** replied that all his possessions are the rags he wears and a few books, that wherever he is exiled he will still be God’s guest, that he considers his body already dead in Christ, and that death would just bring him to a happy reunion with God. The captain was astounded.

  - Emperor **Valens** arrived in Caesarea and made a very rich offering to the altar as a way of showing favor to the city. He expected the citizens themselves to come forward and accept the offering. But they didn’t–they waited until Bishop **Basil** finally came forward to accept the offering. In the eyes of the people, this said that **Basil** was the one in control and would not be bullied by the emperor

- **Basil** devoted the rest of his life to his duties as a bishop and to writing for various causes

  - He organized and spread monasticism in the East

  - He wrote frequently in support of the **Nicene** cause against **Arianism**

- He died in 379, before seeing the fruit that his theological work bore at the **Council of Constantinople** in 381

### Gregory of Nyssa (335-394)

<img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ubmB_eH6M7izRO5UlPL7fpwbWHQLvMVL3S1gnC5CpWjZl_PDedOvMj5YLQ9dcF2ODlI0fCjpL7OHPcvncZixMBlubbgVGKi8Ecf3aiuOLIyxdYSPg5Zlu6d1Q08ainvFO2dmu5U56U_Kir1BOg" width="150" style="float: right" />

- Totally different from his brother **Basil**, **Gregory of Nyssa** wanted a quiet, humble life

- While his brother and **Gregory of Nazianzus** were starting their monastic community, **Gregory** married. But when she died, he joined the monastic life as a way of escaping the sorrows of a more active, secular life

  - He wrote a treatise called [**_On Virginity_**](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2907.htm), which explored his pain at seeing his wife suffer through childbirth and his later pain at losing her

- Became respected as a mystic, and an example of humility and thoughtfulness. He studied and wrote a lot.

- But eventually his brother **Basil**, now bishop, called him to help fight the **Arians**. **Gregory** was made bishop of the small town of Nyssa

- **Gregory** hated the strife of publicly fighting **Arianism** so much that he went into hiding

- However, by 381 and the **Council of Constantinople** – after **Basil** had died – **Gregory of Nyssa** attended the council and calmly explained the **Nicene** doctrines so convincingly that he had a great effect in defeating **Arianism**

- The emperor of the **Council**, **Theodosius**, was an orthodox **Nicene** Christian, and he was so impressed with **Gregory** that he made him his advisor and took him all over the empire

- **Gregory** put up with this as long as it was necessary, but eventually he was able to return to the monastic life, where he ended his days quietly and anonymously. We do not even know for sure the date or circumstances of his death.

#### Major Works

- [**_The Creation of Man_**](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2914.htm)

  - A sermon he wrote to complete **Basil’s** _Six Days_

- [**_Great Catechesis_**](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2908.htm)

  - Uses the philosophy of Plato to help explain the **Trinity**

  - Follows in the tradition of **Origen** somewhat, especially regarding a hope for **universal salvation / universalism**

  - Uses the life of his sister **Macrina** to give instructions on holy living and the monastic life

- **_Life of Moses_**

  - Uses the story of the Exodus as a pattern to describe the soul’s progress from sin to a vision of God

  - Emphasizes that the spiritual life is not static, but is one of constant progress

### Gregory “the Theologian” of Nazianzus (330-389)

- After some 10 years at the monastic community with **Basil**, **Gregory** returned to his hometown of Nazianzus where he had been ordained as a priest. The church there wanted him as a priest even though he was reluctant

  - He gave a famous sermon on the duties of a pastor where he confessed that he preferred the monastic life of contemplation and feared that he would be unworthy of the task of pastorship, calling leadership even harder to learn than obedience

  <img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/OxJUW_bQmt-EmJTzK8frvkEnAjDZEhgGuuC8k2ZqWKKJRijN82rMXktXq0PuyImgEthvPjtmkavfRNFBVykfP_XPemv0PHkuQ_YAreEN6_XL_vAeETA4LxC7vOVeQ14Mq-z2LXfTQgQiZPUpiw" width="150" style="float: right" />

- In 372, Bishop **Basil** made **Gregory** a bishop of a small town against his will, and this strained their friendship. **Gregory** in fact decided not to assume the bishopric and returned to Nazianzus

- In the next 2 years, several of **Gregory’s** beloved family members died, many of whom were also influential Christians. In grief, he left the pastorship of Nazianzus to become a monk

- When **Basil** died in 379, Gregory was moved to come out of retirement and take up the standard of **Nicene** Christianity against **Arianism**

- He went to the imperial capital of Constantinople, which was completely **Arian**. There wasn’t a single orthodox **Nicene** church in the city. But **Gregory** started one

  - This church was persecuted by the **Arians**, but **Gregory** composed many hymns to encourage his congregation. These hymns are still sung in the Greek Orthodox Church.

- 380 – **Theodosius**, a **Nicene** Christian, becomes emperor. He expels **Arians** from all high positions and asks **Gregory** to take over the main church congregation of Constantinople

  - **Gregory** tried to decline it, but the crowd saw a ray of sunlight break through a cloudy day to light upon him and took it as a sign of God’s favor, and they started chanting that they wanted him for bishop.

  - **Gregory** finally accepted the role, and became the patriarch of Constantinople (what they called the bishop of a major city in the East)

- 381 – **Council of Constantinople** is called by  **Theodosius** to settle the doctrine of the **Trinity**. **Gregory of Nazianzus**, as bishop of the city, presides, though he remarks that he still doesn’t like such a loud and public life

  - Some of his opponents complained that he was still technically bishop of Nazianzus as well as Constantinople, and that it was wrong for him to hold two bishoprics. **Gregory** promptly resigned and returned home

  - His successor in Constantinople did a good job

  - He continued to refuse all calls to return to public life, but continued to write and correspond with friends on various topics, including theology, and thus continued to exert influence over other bishops and priests

- 389 - died at home

#### Major Works

- **_Philocalia_**

  - An anthology of various theological and devotional writings of **Origen** to preserve his legacy

  - A collaboration with **Basil**

- **_Five Theological Orations_**

  - Dramatically defend the Trinity

- Many [**_letters_**](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3103.htm), [**_sermons_**](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3102.htm), and poems

## Cappadocian Legacy

- Had a massive influence on the **Council of Constantinople (381)**, which not only affirmed the **Nicene Creed** against **Arianism**, but revised the **Creed** to affirm the equal deity of the **Holy Spirit**. This is where the full doctrine of the **Trinity** is first expressed

  - The formula was now “**one essence in three persons**”

  - This essentially ended **Arianism** as a major influence in the Roman Empire, although the heresy found ways to hang on in distant areas

- Greek **monasticism** grew into a long and distinguished heritage in the East

- The hymns of **Gregory of Nazianzus** are still sung today
